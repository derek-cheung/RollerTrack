# RollerTrack
This library allows attaching a roller track to a RecyclerView. The roller track provides faster navigation and visualisation for users 
facing long lists. It is designed to work with sorted lists of related content with fixed, pre-determined datasets. Example good use cases
are a catalogue of items grouped alphabetically or a list of events grouped by starting time.
